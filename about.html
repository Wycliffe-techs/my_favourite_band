    <p>Outside of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, The Kinks were arguably the most iconic of all British bands to emerge during the 60s and their legacy remains among the most enduring in rock’n’roll history.</p>
    <p>Active from 1963-96, their astonishing career yielded five Top 10 singles on America’s Billboard charts, along with five UK Top 40 albums and 17 Top 20 singles. Their industry awards, meanwhile, include an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Services to Music and inductions into both the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame and the UK Music Hall Of Fame. In terms of influence too, it’s hard to imagine how the British music scene would have evolved without The Kinks’ presence. The band’s music initially inspired contemporaries such as The Who’s Pete Townshend; their 1967 LP, Something Else By The Kinks, would become an important touchstone for The Jam’s frontman Paul Weller when his band recorded their reputation-enshrining late 1970s LPs All Mod Cons and Setting Sons; and, in the 90s, Britpop-era bands such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp all admitted to a long-term admiration of The Kinks’ catalogue.</p>
    <p>The band’s first UK No 1, August 1964’s ‘You Really Got Me’, featured a raunchy, distorted guitar riff from Dave Davies. Achieved through Davies hacking a slice in his Elpico amplifier (usually referred to as his “little green amp”), the riff is often cited as the blueprint for the heavy metal sound later pioneered by bands such as Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer, and it also inspired a generation of US garage bands during the mid-60s.</p>
